It addresses the expression problem using multiple-dispatch as a paradigm that enables highly expressive syntax and composable code and the two-language problem using just-in-time compilation to create high-performance code. For these reasons, the Julia language is gaining popularity in scientific computing and data analysis because it offers significant improvements in performance and composability. That is, how existing code and libraries work with one another.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"About Web Technologies and Cloud Computing","title":"About Web Technologies and Cloud Computing","text":"Traditionally, scientific computing programs run without user interaction as batch jobs on computer clusters and supercomputers. However, modern scientific computing and data analytics increasingly requires user interaction.

We can expose the analytics application over the internet as an on-demand service by wrapping it inside a web application or microservice and deploying it into a cloud platform. Given the advantages of the Julia language, it would be natural to develop the analytics application and the web application or microservice in Julia language.","category":"page"},{"location":"#About-Cloud-Computing","page":"About Web Technologies and Cloud Computing","title":"About Cloud Computing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"About Web Technologies and Cloud Computing","title":"About Web Technologies and Cloud Computing","text":"For getting started with web application development and cloud computing, we assume basic knowledge of the Linux operating system, Git version control system, Julia language, and SQL databases.
