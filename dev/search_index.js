For these reasons, the Julia language is gaining popularity in scientific computing and data analysis because it offers significant improvements in performance and composability. That is, how existing code and libraries work with one another.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Traditionally, scientific computing programs run without user interaction as batch jobs on computer clusters and supercomputers. However, modern scientific computing and data analytics increasingly requires user interaction. For example, an analytics application may receive data from multiple sources over the internet, process the data, perform analysis, store results, and offer them to end-users on demand via an API. We can expose the analytics application over the internet as an on-demand service by wrapping it inside a web application or microservice and deploying it into a cloud platform.
